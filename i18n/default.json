	"mail.aelin1.text": "To @-^I apologize again for the... rather unseemly display when we met. I suppose I got too worked up seeing a human so far in the woods... no one seems to know my grove exists.^^As an apology, I've attached a simple medicine recipe that I use regularly. It's a potent painkiller that may be of good use to you in working the fields.^^   -Aelin",
	"mail.aelin2.text": "To @-^Thank you for visiting me yesterday. It's... rather nice, having company over. I suppose I should start preparing refreshments in case you come by again?^^I was digging through my old books and found this recipe. I don't get to make much use of it, since I don't go out enough to warrant using it. But, maybe you can use it.^^   -Aelin",
	"mail.aelin3.text": "Dear @,^You know, you coming over so frequently has been quite a blessing. Perhaps I'm imagining things, but I feel like I've got more energy than usual lately. Could it be because of your connection to the forest? Or perhaps it's just your sunny personality? I can't even guess.^^As thanks, I'd like to share this recipe with you. It's an old tonic rumored to foster a connection to nature. Unfortunately, I don't get to make it much... I can't grow strawberries to save my life.^^   -Aelin",
	"mail.aelin4.text": "Dearest @,^Since our first meeting, you've shown me nothing but kindness, and you've been so patient with me in spite of my weakness. I was terribly rude to you when you brought me to the clinic... if you hadn't, I may not be here now, and I'm truly sorry for how I treated you.^^You are a true friend of nature, and I want to give you a gift. This recipe is an ancient one, passed down from nature spirits to humanity as a gift of trust, and I wish for you to have it.^^May the blessings of nature follow you always.^^   -Your Friend, Aelin",

Things have been rather quiet in the forest... it's become rather lonely.^^I was thinking about the past, and I remembered an old tea recipe that I made for a friend, many years ago.
