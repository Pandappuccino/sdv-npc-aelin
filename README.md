# Aelin, the Last Nature Spirit
*Hundreds of years ago, humans and spirits coexisted in harmony, with the spirits blessing humans with bountiful harvests and crystal-clear water, and the humans offering the spirits the fruits of their labor as thanks. Over time, however, humanity became greedy, demanding more from nature than they would give, and soon the fragile balance between humans and spirits shattered. One by one, the spirits faded away, taking with them their blessings, and humanity was forced to survive without the gifts they so cruelly took for granted.*

*Now, legends of the spirits have all but disappeared from history, save those few records preserved by those who practice the arcane arts--and it is one such practitioner who has seen glimpses and heard whispers of a single spirit, left behind for so many ages, deep inthe heart of Cindersap Forest...*

This is the largest mod I've made so far and one I'm excited to share with everyone--my custom NPC, **Aelin**! Aelin is a nature spirit, a personification of the energy of nature itself, who has grown weak due to the many, many ages and the connection between humans and nature weakening so much. That said, he is a potential bachelor for your farmer to meet, befriend, and possibly even marry...but this mod also includes a point of no return that you must be aware of.

## Features
- A new NPC--Aelin--with original dialogue, custom events, and more
- New items and recipes to unlock
- A new area to discover in the Secret Woods, the Hidden Grove
- And more!

## Installation
Download the mod either here on Github, or via [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/32819). Unzip the folder and place it into your Mods folder, and you're all set!

## Translations
The mod contains i18n keys for ease of translation! By default the mod is in English.

## Configuration Options
There are a handful of configuration options that you can use to make befriending Aelin easier, change his appearance, and more. The configuration options available are:
- **Seasonal Designs:** By default, Aelin has seasonal designs and his appearance changes with the seasons. However, you can disable this if you prefer.
- **Default Design:** If Seasonal Designs is disabled, you can specify which appearance he uses--Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter.
- **Alternate Gift Tastes:** By default, Aelin has *very* particular gift tastes. This toggle loads a different set of gift tastes, making it slightly easier to befriend him.


## Mod Compatibility
I've been working my butt off to make sure this mod is compatible with various mods. For the most part, the big compatibility options are for gift tastes--I actually went through the mods I use to add specific gift tastes to match his default tastes. The mod has built-in compatibility for the following mods:
- [Stardew Valley Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753)﻿: Because of the way the Secret Woods and Cindersap Forest maps get changed, there is a patch built-in to change the location of the Secret Grove. He also has gift tastes built-in.
- [Mobile Phone Continued](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21017)﻿: For immersion purposes, Aelin does *not* have a phone until a certain point (the same point where he can move into an apartment), and so he cannot be called, and cannot call the player.


## NPC Interactions
Aelin has built-in custom interactions with some other custom NPCs I like to use! If you have the same NPCs installed, there are additional patches built into the mod that include some additional content:
- [Eugene](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9222)﻿: Adds two events, custom dialogue, a quest line, and an extra item and recipe; also adjusts a line in Aelin's gift dialogue.
- [Romanceable Rasmodius Redux Revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16893)﻿: Adds an event, custom dialogue, and a quest line; also adjusts Aelin's schedule after a certain point.


## Custom Gift Tastes
By default, Aelin has custom gift tastes for the following mods:
- [Blue Eggs and Golden Mayo](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20266)
- [Bees Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30597)
- [Lucky Clover](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/33111)
- [Stardew Valley Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753)﻿
- [Wild Eggs](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20222)


## Meeting Aelin
There are some requirements to be able to meet Aelin for the first time; the player won't be able to cheese things early with Noclip or spawning in items.
- The player must first meet with the Wizard and obtain the ability to read Junimo text; the game won't load any of Aelin's assets until this flag is triggered.
- The player must have a Steel Axe or better to be able to enter the Secret Woods.
- The player must enter the Hidden Grove on a sunny day, between 6AM and 6PM, to view Aelin's introduction event.

Once you've met Aelin, congratulations, now you can start to befriend him! However, you may have noticed that he's very frail, and he mentioned that the anchor tethering him to the human world is quite weak. This is not just flavor text--it's a warning: ***if you buy a Joja membership, Aelin will die and be unavailable for the rest of the save.*** This is retroactive: no matter how many bundles you've completed in the Community Center, the second you decide to buy a membership, it's all over.

## New Items
There are a handful of new cooking items to make and profit off of included with this mod, with the recipes to obtain them earned by befriending Aelin and viewing his events, and an extra, secret item that can be obtained if you also have [Eugene](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9222)﻿ in your game world.
- **Pain Tonic (Meet Aelin):** Requires 3 Poppy and 1 Honey. Restores a modest amount of HP and energy, and grants +3 Defense for two hours (simulating a numbness to pain).
- **Energizing Tonic (Two Hearts):** Requires 2 Kale, 1 Carrot, and 1 Honey. Restores a decent amount of HP and Energy, and grants +2 Speed for two hours.
- **Sunshine Tonic (Four Hearts):** Requires 3 Strawberry, 3 Summer Spangle, and 1 Honey. Restores a modest amount of HP and Energy, and grants +3 Farming and Foraging for an hour.
- **Ancient Tonic (Eight Hearts):** Requires 3 Ancient Fruit, 3 Sweet Gem Berry, 3 Mystic Syrup, and 3 Honey. Fully restores HP and Energy, and grants +3 to all stats for the rest of the day.
- **Strawberry Tea (Complete "A Secret Gift", exclusive to Eugene):** Requires 3 Tea Leaves, 1 Strawberry, and 1 Honey. A universally-liked gift that is also loved by Aelin, Evelyn, Leah, Sandy, and Emily.

The four "Tonic" items are a universal dislike, with some exceptions: Vincent, Jas, and Leo hate all four items, while Alex, George, Robin, and Clint like Pain Tonic.

If the player buys a Joja membership, the first four recipes will instead be delivered by Harvey upon purchasing certain developments, and the Strawberry Tea recipe will be delivered once the player reaches six hearts with Eugene.
